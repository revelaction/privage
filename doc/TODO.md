- bug: complete with privage show domain.com@myemail@mail.com: does not complete at first @ if many
- clipboard does not belong in credential -> move
- document credential custom fields Others in readme
- consider removing email and login from config struct
- privage like git current dir or not for add. maybe not
- MODERN HEADER => later
    what about 4. PROBLEM that would be future!!!!
    in header we could define privage/v2
        add code
- audit read.go audit resource leak
- audit write.go audit resource leak thead external
- doc yubikey in readme and doc file
- claude tesetscript consistency and detailed commented tests
- document yubikey
- fs.go os.HOmeDIR as var and as type fucnt in types. two different approaches for mocking unify
    -unify
-fs brittle for open 
	fs needed?
    also var consquences for parallel tests
    at leaset document better in relation to parallel tests
- unit tests rotate init etc
- if s.Id.Id == nil { check unify in main?
	setup hasId other methods?
- status code review of the output 
- pin Auth PIN
    - considerations with autocompletion
    - enforce no AUth, per slot??
- clipboard second argument like show 
- fields command?
